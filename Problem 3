Problem 3

1.	Changes I make for the problem 1:
  a.	I change SelectedCat= 7 to SelectedCat = ’Snowball II’
  b.	Snowball II didn’t have a food in “treats” list so I add ‘Fish’ to the list
  c.	Last error was on the “print” –command. I change treats(SelectedCat) to mode treats(CatIndex).
  
  
2.	The most difficult thing was to upload the file to the GitHub. 
    Overall the creating code was the easiest part of the problem. 
    I followed the lesson’s instructions carefully so they were very helpful.
    
    
3.	I like: 
    that I learn something new. I don’t have any experience in coding so 
    I was very excited in problem 2, when the code started to work. 
    I didn’t like: 
    that I chose to make exercises in my own old computer, which 
    is very slow, so I did exercises longer than I expected.
    I would change: 
    I don’t make up anything specific, only one little unimportant thing. 
    I apparently learn when I do things on my own. I started to work with 
    Problem 1 but I didn’t understand anything. After that I try to do the 
    problem 2 and it was very easy and straightforward. After that I went back 
    to Problem 1 and understand it more easily. So I would change the order 
    of the exercises (but I think that is just easier for me doing things this way 
    and there isn’t any rule that you should do exercises in the correct order).
